This is a collection of Python and Fortran code used to build my term
paper for AME 559: Advanced Astrodynamics at the University of
Arizona.

# The Problem
The problem under consideration here will be the Circular, Restricted
Three-Body Problem. Specifically, we'll investigate a system comprised
of the Sun, Earth, and a spacecraft, and look at different schemes to
represent the dynamics of the system and how they perform for various
scenarios.
