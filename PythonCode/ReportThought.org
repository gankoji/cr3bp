* Just figured I should get some of this down onto "paper"
Okay so what's left that's important
** Hamiltonian of the System
This system has a hamiltonian that should be conserved. I should show
that it is throughout the simulation. 
** Keplerian Elements of the Orbits
This should be really easy for the earth's orbit (and maybe I should
adjust the elements of the ICs to account for, idk, Earth's *real*
orbit...)

The spacecraft is going to be a bit more difficult. I could show the
Keplerian orbits of the satelite wrt the sun, but those would look
weird. Then again, they would show the perturbed dynamics of the
system if everything were accurate, so maybe that's a good thing. 

I'd also like to show the Keplerian elements of the spacecraft wrt the
Earth, because I feel like those are more likely to be consistent with
the type of perturbations we've been dealing with. Earth is,
realistically, the dominant body in this sim, and the sun is just a
perturber.
